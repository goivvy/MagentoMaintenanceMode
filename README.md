This extension could come handy when you perform an [upgrade](https://www.goivvy.com/magento-2-upgrade-service) or work on [speed optimizations](https://www.goivvy.com/magento-optimization-service) and [customizations](https://www.goivvy.com/magento-development-services).

The extension will automatically whitelist your IP so that you could work on both frontend and backend while the store is in Maintenance Mode.

Contact a [developer](https://www.goivvy.com) with any questions or feature requests.
